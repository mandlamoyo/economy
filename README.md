A Simple Model Economy

This project models a simple economy with only one industry (agriculture). Land owners seek to increase their profit made from selling crops. They do so by setting attractive wages for the best workers and purchase tractors. Workers leave and enter into employment according to desired skill levels and offered wages. There is also a degree of randomness in determining the productivity of each farm, so as to mimic natural variables.

The simulation shows how the employment state and personal wealth of each worker, as well as the capital assets and profits made by each farmer, change over time.

TODO:
